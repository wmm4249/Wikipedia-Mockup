            <p>The 1921/1922 season was Cardiff City's first in the First Division of the Football League following election from the Southern Football League to the Second Division for the 1920/21 season. They had won promotion the previous season, the first Welsh team to reach the top tier of English football, finishing as runners-up behind Birmingham on goal average. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup. Fred Stewart remained manager and new signings included full back Tommy Brown and forward Willie Page. Cardiff were investigated by the FA and the FAW over an illegal approach for Wolverhampton's defender Dickie Baugh and club and player were both fined. John Pritchard was elected chairman, but was replaced in November by Walter Empsall. Cardiff made significant investments in the club's ground, Ninian Park, laying a new pitch and improving viewing for spectators. During the latter work, refuse dumped by Cardiff Corporation caught alight, but the blaze was doused with the aid of local supporters.</p>
